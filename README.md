# RayCasting using JavaScript canvas
This is a simple raycasting simulation where you can control the source of the rays using the arrow keys.  
Those rays are used to generate a 3D perspective from the 2D canvas including the color of each wall.  
It was all made with vanilla JavaScript and the canvas tag.
